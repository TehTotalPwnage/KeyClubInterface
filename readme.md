# KeyClubInterface
**A simple frontend for volunteer club management functions.**

## What is KeyClubInterface?
KeyClubInterface is a program designed to track certain types of information, such as
attendance, event hours, and member information, for volunteer organizations.

The original name of the project was inspired by the organization it was first designed
for, the AHS Key Club. However, this project is now working for various organizations,
including Leo Club, CSF, and Renaissance.
